Computer Setup Instructions - dell xps 9575

1) Ubuntu 18.04 to allow for ROS-Melodic boot key 

2) Upon setup - had error: Permission error in software center on clean Ubuntu 18.04
	tried this: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/am0nof/permission_error_in_software_center_on_clean/
	a) $ sudo apt update
	b) $ sudo apt upgrade (this took a while)
	->the computer will restart
	-> error still showed up, but I installed gitkraken to check and it worked fine

	followed advice on link.. deleted the folder /home/[user]/.config/ibus/bus and then ran 
	$ sudo gnome-software

3) $ sudo apt install wget

4) downloading chrome:
	$ wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
	$ sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
	-> delete the deb file you downloaded with wget in the home folder

4) install git 
	$sudo apt install git

5) install gitkraken
	$ wget https://release.gitkraken.com/linux/gitkraken-amd64.deb
	$ sudo dpkg -i gitkraken-amd64.deb
	-> delete .deb file in home folder

6) installing WINE to allow windows programs
	installing wine with https://wine.htmlvalidator.com/install-wine-on-ubuntu-18.04.html
	
	$ wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
	$ sudo -H gpg -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/winehq.key.gpg --dearmor winehq.key
	$ sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ bionic main
	$ sudo apt update
	$ wget -nc https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/amd64/libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_amd64.deb
	$ wget -nc https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/i386/libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_i386.deb
	$ sudo apt install ./libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_amd64.deb
	$ sudo apt install ./libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_i386.deb
	$ sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
	$ wine winecfg -> install mono (once) and gecko (twice), edit windows 7 to windows 10 in the opened config panel

7) allow exFAT Drive on ubuntu linux (my sandisk external ssd drive)
	$ sudo add-apt-repository universe
	$ sudo apt update 
	$ sudo apt install exfat-fuse exfat-utils

8) install curl
	https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-curl-command-on-a-ubuntu-linux/
	$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
	$ sudo apt install curl
	$ curl --version
	$ apt-cache search libcurl | grep python
	$ sudo apt install python3-pycurl

9) install nordVPN
	$ sudo apt-get install ./nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install nordvpn
	
	or maybe just: $ sh <(curl -sSf https://downloads.nordcdn.com/apps/linux/install.sh)
	https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1047409422/How-can-I-connect-to-NordVPN-using-Linux-Terminal.htm
	-> this had problems when trying to run commands like $nordvpn login
	$ sudo usermod -aG nordvpn $USER' -> reboot
	-> after reboot test by logging in: $nordvpn login
	$ nordvpn connect
	

	To install GUI	
	$ cd
	$ mkdir repos
	$ cd repos
	$ git clone https://github.com/byoso/Nord-Manager
	$ cd Nord-Manager
	$ ./install.sh
	-> RTFM - read the fucking manual!
	-> btw, the program open a menu button in the top right hand side of the monitor 

10) install transmission - torrent service
	$ sudo apt install transmission
	-> in order to download torrents I had to use my VPN which had problems... changed the connection protocol
	$ nordvpn set protocol TCP

11) install unrar
	$ sudo apt-get install unrar

12) install ros-melodic !!! THIS WILL BE DONE LATER. SKIP THIS ONE !!!
	http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
	
	$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
	$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full


13) install windows virtual machine
	instructions:
		https://itsfoss.com/install-windows-10-virtualbox-linux/
		there might be problem with secure boot: 
			https://superuser.com/questions/1438279/how-to-sign-a-kernel-module-ubuntu-18-04
		I also used these instructions but I don't think they are needed
			https://stegard.net/2016/10/virtualbox-secure-boot-ubuntu-fail/

	$ sudo apt install virtualbox -> password: funsudus (regular)
	$ sudo reboot

	after following the manual to create a dynamical virtual machine (4GB ram, 200GB ssd, I think this can be changed later), 	
	I opened the VM and loggined into my microsoft account. 

	I noticed I cant drag and drop in between discovered I had to install "windows guest additions"
	This can be done automatically by going through the first two lines in section 4.2.1.1 in the link below (Devices->Insert Guest Addition CD Image...)
	https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/guestossupport.html -> Guest Additions
	This is also a good video on the subject:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrqy0Q_zhzI&ab_channel=TechMeSpot
	Windows now had drivers install, it was much faster, and I could copy text from ubuntu host to windows guest.. but file dropping was still a problem for some reason.
	
	I also wanted to know how to do file sharing between the ubuntu host and windows guest
	These are good links to look at: https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/virtualbox-share-folder-host-guest/ AND https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYmck1G0fqY&ab_channel=TheHowToGuy123

	One last thing.. "sending the shut down signal" didn't do anything. I had to go to the power options in the guest windows and change what pressing the power button does:
	https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=98084

		
14) install GDebi package installer
https://www.ubuntu18.com/install-gdebi-ubuntu-18/

	$ sudo add-apt-repository universe
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
	
15) install crossover by codeweave #May not use this in the future, its a 2 week trail as an "extension" to wine
	download deb file from  https://www.codeweavers.com/support/wiki/linux/linuxtutorial/install#deb
	install with GDebi $ sudo gdebi crossover_21.0.0-1.deb

	after reading about microsoft office's compatability in their forums I understood that they still have some problems. Virtual machine works great and I think I will stick with that.

16) installing onedrive 

	#31/1/2022: FOR 20.04, INSTEAD OF WHAT IS BELOW, I JUSTED USED THIS GUIDE:
		#https://idroot.us/install-onedrive-ubuntu-20-04/
		$ sudo apt update
		$ sudo apt upgrade
		$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yann1ck/onedrive
		$ sudo apt install onedrive
		$ onedrive --synchronize

	#FOLLOW THIS FOR 18.04:
		https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#dependencies-ubuntu-18x-ubuntu-19x-ubuntu-20x--debian-9-debian-10---x86_64
		to view configuration - "onedrive --display-config"

	onedrive doesnt start when the user logs in. I will need to add "onedrive --monitor" to the command startup application
	typing "how to add command to startup ubuntu" in google explained the "how to" right away.
	this is a useful link: https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/02/how-to-keep-onedrive-in-sync-with.html
		$ systemctl --user enable onedrive
		$ systemctl --user start onedrive
		$ systemctl status --user onedrive

	Finally, I shared the onedrive folder with my windows virtual machine :)

17) installing vscode  - I did that from the Ubuntu Software
	note: typing "$ code ." will open vscode in the current folder :)

18) Creating a link (aka shortcut) for important folders
	We need to activate "Show action to create symbolic links" under the Behavior tabs of the Nautilus preferences
	https://askubuntu.com/questions/861333/how-to-open-nautilus-file-manager-preferences#:~:text=Alt%20F3%20and%20%22More%20Actions,right%20corner%20of%20the%20window.

	to show the original folder's path
	$ pwd -P 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29789204/bash-how-to-get-real-path-of-a-symlink

19) install "shutter" for screenshots. The software runs in ubuntu but I can paste the images into the windows VM easly

20) install virtual enviorment manager for python - virtualenv
	
	https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-python-virtualenv-and-a-conda-environment
	"
	Conda environments are essentially a replacement for virtualenv. Both conda environments and virtualenv are aimed at creating an “environment” with isolated package installs. 
	They aim to solve the problem of having multiple python projects on the same system with conflicting package requirements. 
	If you have project A that requires tensorflow-1.8 and project B that uses tensorflow-1.9,
	these environments allow you to have the right version installed for each project.

	The main difference between the two is that conda is a bit more full featured/”magic”. 
	Conda has dedicated syntax for creating environments and installing packages, and can also manage installing different versions of python too. 
	For virtualenv, you just activate the environment and then use all the normal commands.

	For example, for conda the command for a new environment named “myenv” using python 3.4, scipy version 0.15.0, and packages astroid and babel of any version:
	
	$conda create -n myenv python=3.4 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel 
	
	In virtualenv:

	<manually install python 3.4 however your system installs it> 
	$ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.4 myenv 
	$ source myenv/bin/activate 
	$ pip install scipy==0.15.0 
	$ pip install astroid 
	$ pip install babel 
	"

	https://deeplearning.lipingyang.org/2018/12/23/anaconda-vs-miniconda-vs-virtualenv/
	"
	Some context: Pip is a package manager, and virtualenv is an environment manager; and conda is both.
	Specifically, conda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to do more than what pip does; it handles library dependencies outside of the Python packages as well as the Python packages themselves. 		Conda also creates a virtual environment, like virtualenv does.
	Choose Virtualenv only when you have sudo access to the machine you are working on. 
	It is much easier to setup conda rather than virtualenv for a regular (i.e., non sudo/root) user on a linux/Mac machine.
	"

	We will install virtualenv as we want less things to confine us. 
	I also read somehere that packages that are installed with pip are different from those installed with conda, and so this may cause problems down the line when some package is only configured for pip.
	

	a) Installing virtualenv - installation is through python 3, but we can also create enviorments in python2
		https://tech.serhatteker.com/post/2018-12/virtualenv/
		
		$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
		$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv


	b) testing with PythonRobotics
		
		$ cd
		$ cd repos
		$ git clone https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics
		$ cd PythonRobotics
		$ python3 -m venv env #this will create a folder called env which will hold all the packages and the such. It is recommended to put it under git ignore. DONT USE THIS METHOD. CALL VIRTUALENV TO CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIORMENT, NOT PYTHON.
		$ source env/bin/activate %activate the enviorment
		$ which python #confirm location of python interpreter:
		$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt #installing packages from requirements.txt
		!!! This failed because PythonRobotics was written in Python2 and we created an enviorment in Python3! (This was later discovered to be completely wrong)

		a) deactivate the current enviorment -> $deactivate
		b) delete the env folder
		c) create a new python2 enviorment, this time in a hidden folder -> $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 .venv
		d) source the new enviorment -> $ source .venv/bin/activate
		e) install the requirements -> $ pip install -r requirements.txt
		!!! This also failed for some reason... I just installed the packages writen in requirements.txt manually
		$pip install numpy
		$pip install scipy
		...
		finally the last one had a problem, $pip install cvxpy -> ERROR: Could not build wheels for osqp which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly
		to view list of packages insatlled on our env -> $pip list --local
		!!! I opened the PythonRobotics README.md and noticed that they do require python 3.9... Trying with python 3 again! (deleting .venv after deactivating)


		-> discovered that cvxpy requires python>3.7 and I was using 3.6.9
		
		Installing python 3.9
		from https://askubuntu.com/questions/1318846/how-do-i-install-python-3-9:
		$ sudo apt update
		$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
		$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa 
		$ sudo apt update
		$ sudo apt install python3.9
		$ python3.9 --version -> Python 3.9.x

		$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.9 .venv
		$ source .venv/bin/activate
		
		I noticed pip3 install faills... 
		I looked into the default version of python the system which was running was python 2.7
		To verify: open a new terminal, and write $python --version
		To Change default: $ alias python=python3.9 (this will be needed on every new terminal, unless inserted into .bashrc)
		-> this also failed

		I tried this command:
	 		$ sudo apt install python3.9-distutils 
		following advice from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55749206/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-distutils-core
		It solved pip3 install, but this still fails.
		
		Finaly, I installed the dev package for python 3.9 using:
			$ sudo apt-get install python3.x-dev
		Following advice from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26053982/setup-script-exited-with-error-command-x86-64-linux-gnu-gcc-failed-with-exit.
		This worked!
	
		To configure vs code to work with virtual enviorments, I read https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments:
			a) open the search bar with cntrl+shift+p
			b) seach "Python: Select Interpreter"
			c) add/select the interpeter from .venv

		Note: my virtual enviorment size with ~300MB. If im planning on having lots of projects, I might aswell learn to use virtualenvwrapper. 

		another good read for command and such: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

21) install dropbox
	INSTEAD OF WHAT IS BELOW: 
		$ sudo apt install nautilus-dropbox (04.04.2022)

	a) download the file from https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux
	$ cd ~/Downloads
	$ sudo gdebi dropbox*
	You will probably be asked to restart the computer. Opening dropbox will open an application on the top right hand of the main screen, very much like the nordVPN addon.

22) install virtualenvwrapper

	guide: https://medium.com/@aaditya.chhabra/virtualenv-with-virtualenvwrapper-on-ubuntu-34850ab9e765
	
	$ sudo apt update
	$ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
	$ sudo apt install virtualenvwrapper
	$ export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs -> 
	add "./usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" to ~./bashrc - This was wrong in my case..
	INSTEAD: $ echo "source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

	-> type $ virtualenvwrapper to view commands 

	creating a venv in a "project" using virtualenvwrapper: having a "project" will cd to the correct dir when using the "workon" command
	$ export PROJECT_HOME=$(pwd) #assuming terminal is in the project's dir
	$ mkproject -p /usr/bin/python3.9 PythonRobotics #python3.9 is an example, here "PythonRobotics" is the venv's name
	# if the project's path was not as you intended, you can use $ setvirtualenvproject while working on the project and inside the correct dir
	$ deactivate
	$ cd ..
	$ workon PythonRobotics
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	#turns out that to view stuff in matplotlib I also need some graphics
	$ pip3 install PyQt5


23) Install ros melodic with all dependecies
	# in 20.04 use the following link "https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu"

	following http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
	
	$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
	$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

	$ echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc #change this if moving to noetic or other verison
	$ sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
	$ sudo apt install python-rosdep
	$ sudo rosdep init
	$ rosdep update

	$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-catkin
	
	NOTE! when creating a workspace in melodic or under, use the following to enable python3
	$ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
	#from http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

24) nautiulus -> opening current directory in file explorer
	$ nautilus "$(pwd)"
	
25) learning how to create xml files...I use vscode to guide me. This is the extension I tried out:
	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml

26) How to set up my Monitor at the lab:
	https://askubuntu.com/questions/393400/is-it-possible-to-have-different-dpi-configurations-for-two-different-screens

	$ xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 3840x2160 --scale 1x1 --rotate normal
	$ xrandr --output DP-1-2 --mode 1920x1080 --scale 2x2 --pos 3840x1080 --rotate normal

	$ sudo apt install arandr -> run arandr to confirm monitor locations
	had some error "Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
			$ sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386
			$ sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
	from https://askubuntu.com/questions/342202/failed-to-load-module-canberra-gtk-module-but-already-installed
	-> second one did the trick

	did this aswell :https://askubuntu.com/questions/6137/saving-monitor-settings  -------- NOT SURE IF ANY GOOD, REMOVED INSTALLED ITEMS OF THIS
	$ sudo wget -O /usr/local/sbin/update-monitor-position https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/ubuntu-scripts/master/ubuntugnome/update-monitor-position
	$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/update-monitor-position
	$ sudo wget -O /usr/share/applications/update-monitor-position.desktop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/ubuntu-scripts/master/ubuntugnome/update-monitor-position.desktop
	$ sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/update-monitor-position.desktop

	SOLUTION: (email I wrote mark)
	After writing you the email I figured it must be the usb-c to HDMI. It worked perfectly in the past when connecting to a TV, but this is a 		monitor after-all.
	I know it has an internal chip that converts DP data to HDMI data as the usb-c outputs DP.
	I figured it must be some kind of an initialization function that is missed when the stars don't align (or in my case, some frequency).
	Two solutions:
	1) place a command to disconnect and reconnect the monitor on a loop, until initialization occurred.
	2) switch to a usb-c to DP cable. 
	
	
27) How to create new document from ubuntu GUI
	https://www.how2shout.com/linux/how-to-create-a-file-in-ubuntu-linux-using-command-gui/
	just run the command $ touch ~/Templates/Text\ document in a terminal
	-> option is enabled now

30) install mendeley
	from https://www.mendeley.com/guides/download-mendeley-desktop/ubuntu/instructions
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install ./mendeleydesktop

31) Brasero for .iso backup of computer - Found this not so useful currently
	from https://vitux.com/how-to-create-an-iso-file-in-ubuntu/
	$ sudo apt install brasero

32) Backing up my system - NOT USED ANYMORE. I USE THE "deja dup" back utility which is the default one for ubuntu. it's listed as Backups with a safe icon
	guide - https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087: ALSO CONTAINS THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESTORING

	What should I use to backup my system then?" might you ask. Easy; the same thing you use to backup/compress everything else; TAR. Unlike Windows, Linux doesn't restrict root access to anything, so you can just throw every single file on a partition in a TAR file!

	$ sudo su
	$ cd /
	
	$ tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /
	OR 
	$ tar cvpjf backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /
	

	Restoration:
	$ tar xvpfz backup.tgz -C /
	OR
	$ tar xvpfj backup.tar.bz2 -C /

	$ mkdir proc
	$ mkdir lost+found
	$ mkdir mnt
	$ mkdir sys
	etc...

	$ sudo reboot
	
	
	$ tar -cvpzf /backup.tar.gz --exclude=/backup.tar.gz --one-file-system /

	
	a little different: https://askubuntu.com/questions/7809/how-to-back-up-my-entire-system
	'''
	To restore your files when the system goes pear-shaped, use a Live CD. Mount the bad system under /media or /mnt and then run tar xf /path/to/drive/with/backup.tar.gz -C /mnt (or /media).

33) Downloading and installing ubuntu-tweak ->>> This didnt work! 
	https://github.com/tualatrix/ubuntu-tweak
	"Ubuntu Tweak is a tool that makes it easy to configure your system and desktop settings."
	Basically making paths managing a-lot easier
	
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt upgrade
	
	from instructions:
	$ sudo python setup.py install

	had an error:
	error: error in setup.cfg: command 'build' has no such option 'i18n'

	$ sudo apt install python-distutils-extra resolved that error
	from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3810521/how-to-install-python-distutils#:~:text=you%20can%20use%20sudo%20apt,python3%2Ddistutils%20by%20root%20permission.&text=You%20can%20install%20the%20python,install%20python%2Ddistutils%20should%20suffice.

	this didnt work... trying to open the program produces errors.
	I can't remove it with '$ sudo apt remove' because 

	The following link says to avoid installs with '$ python setup.py install' and to use pip instead.
	Says I need to remove files manually
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550226/python-setup-py-uninstall
	
	luckily, the same link discovered that I can learn which files the installation wrote by reinstalling as follows:
	$ python setup.py install --record files.txt
	and then use '$ xargs rm -rf < files.txt' to delete all those files
	In my case it didnt work and some I had to go and delete with '$ sudo rm -dir <>'

34) number (33) was a failure, but we want to make location bar default in nautilus
	a) aprrently just by pressing 'ctrl+L' will show the location bar in a text way.
	
	b) from https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/how-to-set-location-bar-in-nautilus-as-default
	$ sudo apt update 
	$ sudo apt install dconf-editor -y
	open dconf Editor program via "show applications" that can be found in bottom left
	then change "Always use location entry" in org>gnome>nautilus>preferences
	
	OR
	
	$ gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry true

	Note: Sometimes when asked by ubuntu to pin point a file a special menu will show up that will ask the user to navigate.
		this does not set this menu location entry to true, but 'ctrl+L' trick stil works

35) creating my own bash commands!
	with the help of https://medium.com/devnetwork/how-to-create-your-own-custom-terminal-commands-c5008782a78e

	a) creating the file where the commands are stored 
	$ cd ~
	$ touch .my_custom_commands.sh
	$ chmod +x .my_custom_commands.sh
	$ gedit .my_custom_commands.sh
	
	copy the following to the file:	
	#!/bin/bash
	
	# prints the input
	function print_my_input() {
	  echo 'Your input: ' $1
	}

	add 'source ~/.my_custom_commands.sh' to ~/.bashrc 
	this can be done manually or by the following command $ echo "source ~/.my_custom_commands.sh" >> ~/.bashrc 

	open a new terminal, then try $ print_my_input 'test'
	
	b) open nautilus in pwd
	function nautilus_here() {
		nautilus "$pwd"	
	}

	c) change terminal path of linke'd folder to real folder
	function link2real() {
		cd $(pwd -P)
	}

36) Fixing monitor problems... https://askubuntu.com/questions/1033785/external-monitor-not-detected-on-ubuntu-18-04

37) add apps to right click nautilus-actions.
	#in 20.04: 
		$ sudo apt update
		$ sudo apt -y install nautilus-actions

	Note about PPAs: from https://itsfoss.com/how-to-remove-or-delete-ppas-quick-tip/
	'''
	in the effort to install various applications in Ubuntu or other Linux distribution, you often end up adding several PPA.

	Over the time these PPAs might not be updated with the latest version of the operating system. This might create trouble when you try 		updating Ubuntu. You may end up with “Repository does not have a release file” error.

	You may have other reasons as well for deleting or removing a PPA from your system. Whatever be your reason, let me show you how to 		remove a PPA from your system.

	Note: You should uninstall the application in Ubuntu which was installed by the PPA before removing the PPA itself. You can use the ‘apt 		remove’ command for that.

48) install cmake version 3.22 WITHOUT REMOVING THE DEFAULT 3.10
	When upgrading we can remove and then install the new version, but removing cmake 3.10 will also remove critical ROS files which will break the ROS installation.

	$ export PATH=$HOME/LocalInstalls/cmake-install/bin:$PATH
	$ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/LocalInstalls/cmake-install:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

Notes on "sudo make install" vs "make install" from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/20953/difference-between-make-install-and-sudo-make-install
	'''
	As has been answered above, sudo make install lets you install the files in directories which are otherwise read-only to you as a user.

	The problem I can foresee is that at a later date you may want to uninstall or upgrade the program. If you still have the source code directory tree then a make uninstall will uninstall the program for you but if, as many other typical users, you had deleted the source code directory tree then you are out of luck. And since you have not installed the program using a package management system, you may also be unable to uninstall the program that way.

	The best way to install such programs may be to install them in your home directory. Pass the option --prefix=/home/<user>/<some>/<directory> to ./configure. This will allow you to use make install instead of sudo make install since /home/<user>/<some>/<directory> is writable by you. Also uninstallation is a snap -- rm -rf /home/<user>/<some>/<directory>

	--------------------------- NOTES FROM JANUARAY:
	svgfill is a submodule that can be updated via "recursive" cloning... READ INSTRUCTIONS in https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/
	It still makes some problems... that can be solved if we read this issue throughly:
	https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/issues/1761
	
	

51) Deja Dup backup my system!	
	https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/total-system-backup-and-recall-deja-dup/#:~:text=The%20first%20thing%20to%20do,backed%20up%2C%20and%20click%20Add.
	Dont backup onedrive or dropbox - that is retarded.

52) Install Matlab
	b. download from the website - https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/
	a. unzip
	c. install (I installed on $HOME/LocalInstalls/MATLAB/2021b)
		https://www.mathworks.com/matlabccmake ..entral/answers/518584-how-do-i-install-on-ubuntu
	d. create symbolic link to bin so you can activate matlab from the command
		https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/363731-create-symbolic-links-to-matlab-scripts-and-launcher-and-desktop-shortcut
		$ sudo ln -s $HOME/LocalInstalls/MATLAB/2021b/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
	e. to have a matlab icon in favorites tab: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/20-how-do-i-make-a-desktop-launcher-for-matlab-in-linux		$ sudo apt install matlab-support
		
	f. to enable keyboard shortcuts go to Matlab's preferences (under home tab)->  keyboard -> shortcuts -> change "Emacs" to "Windows"
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/103161-why-am-i-unable-to-use-copy-ctrl-c-and-paste-ctrl-v-keyboard-short-cuts-in-the-text-editing-mode

	note: this link also has a cool trick to create a gnome launcher icon to any app installed:	
			'''
			1. Create a linux .desktop file
			$ touch ~/.local/share/applications/matlab.desktop
			2. Add/copy relevant details for app launcher
			[Desktop Entry]
			Version=1.0
			Type=Application
			Terminal=false
			Exec=/path/to/matlab -desktop
			Name=MATLAB RXXXXx
			Icon=/path/to/icon
			Comment=MATLAB
			where /path/to/matlab is recommended to use usr/local/MATLAB/RXXXXx/bin/glnxa64/MATLAB and /path/to/icon is usr/local/MATLAB/RXXXXx/bin/glnxa64/cef_resources/matlab_icon.png
			3. Make the file executable
			$ chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/matlab.desktop
			4. Test the application launcher from the menu
			From here, I had issues with the icons/descriptions to show. To fix this, I did
			5. Move matlab.desktop to the shared applications folder
			$ sudo mv ~/.local/share/applications/matlab.desktop /usr/share/applications
			$ sudo is required since the root folder is protected
			'''

	note: after running "$ matlab" I have had this message in the terminal: 
		'Gtk-Message: 13:21:42.864: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"'

	I had a problem on my second installation (01/02/2022).
	MATLAB was loading up slow, and when loaded an error would show:
	"java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/<user>/.matlab/R2021b/History.xml (Permission denied)"
	solved with  this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28934046/matlab-error-when-opening-an-error-was-encountered-while-saving-the-command-his
	$ sudo chmod -R 777 .matlab (in home directory) (DONT DO THIS)
		-----> This may be really unadvisable:
			https://www.google.com/search?q=chmod+-R+777&oq=chmod+-R+777&aqs=chrome..69i57.3282j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
				#just unadviseable for servers... this is a private system. meh
	to be safer I did this: $ sudo chown -R $LOGNAME: ~/.matlab
	
	I have a second warnning when opening matlab: "Warning: X does not support locale en_IL"
	This was just a language thing I fixed by changing ubuntu settings. 
	figured from here: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1911860



53) Installing xelatex on ubuntu to convert .ipynb to PDFS
	# go here and do this : https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

	OR (I did both)

	#from https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-tex
	$ sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-plain-generic
	#from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29156653/ipython-jupyter-problems-saving-notebook-as-pdf
	$ sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra pandoc texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex

	AND

	pip install nbconvert[webpdf]

	AND (at least for first time)

	$ jupyter nbconvert --execute --to pdf notebook.ipynb --allow-chromium-download

54) using microsoft word through microsoft edge in ubnutu
	https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/01/how-to-install-edge-on-ubuntu-linux

	curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
	sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
	sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge stable main" 		> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-edge-dev.list'
	sudo rm microsoft.gpg

	follow this to install windows word as an app:
	(basically takes the online version and hooks up to it)
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MvXOx8R0jg&ab_channel=InfinitelyGalactic

	I decided not to work this way because it only works with files online.. not in the comnputer

55) Download Arduino IDE

	$ cd ~/Downloads
	$ wget https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.16-linux64.tar.xz #hopefuly this is the updated version, if it isnt.. just download it
	$ tar -xvf arduino-1.8.16-linux64.tar.xz
	$ cd arduino-1.8.16/
	$ sudo ./install.sh

	Once the installation is done, a desktop icon will be created on your desktop. The first 		time you launch it, it will prompt you to trust it with a message as shown below:
	Click the Trust and Launch button to open the app.

# download from here https://unity.com/download
# unzip, and then run the INSTALL.sh file.
# May need to make an executible: chmod +x INSTALL.sh

58) intsalling freecad
https://techoverflow.net/2018/06/03/how-to-fix-freecad-no-module-named-webgui-on-ubuntu-18-04/
	$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable

	$ sudo apt install freecad

59) installing libsuitesparse (for isam, when trying to activate https://github.com/heemonsu/objectSLAM)
	https://github.com/fdp0525/G2LTex/issues/2

	$ sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev

60) install doxygen (used for https://github.com/ori-drs/isam)
	$ sudo apt install doxygen

61) install guvcview for camera control on ubuntu
	$ sudo apt install guvcview

62) installing RGB-D camera sdk D435
	THE WRONG MOVE:
	https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/using-intel-realsense-sdk#2-getting-started
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7JaQvmrVFA&ab_channel=MouserElectronics
	---> https://www.mouser.com/applications/getting-started-with-realsense-d455/

	THE RIGHT MOVE:
	just follow installation protocol from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md#installing-the-packages
	$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key F6E65AC044F831AC80A06380C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE || sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key F6E65AC044F831AC80A06380C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE
	$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://librealsense.intel.com/Debian/apt-repo $(lsb_release -cs) main" -u
	$ sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dkms
	$ sudo apt-get install librealsense2-utils
	$ sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dbg
	$ realsense-viewer (activate)

	Notes on using:
		besides the sdk which I may not really want to use.
		intel offers a bunch of tools. They are already installed on your computer. for 		information on them you can access:
		https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/tools
		example:
		look on rosbag-inspector 
		---> see that the main file is called rs-rosbag-inspector.cpp  
		---> that is the name of the command.
		
		hint: all other tool commands also start with "rs-", and I am most interersted in "rs-convert"
